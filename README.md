# Sharepoint crash course

## Install

- install sharepoint: https://www.microsoft.com/fr-fr/microsoft-365/enterprise/office-365-e5?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab
- create an admin account

- After installing, go to office.com to access all apps and click sharepoint. Then click `Create Site` and choose `Team Site`

## Features

In sharepoint, you can create multiple elements by clicking on `New`:

- Document Library: similar to one drive:
  - each uploaded document has metadata
    - who uploaded it, who modified it last, etc.
    - We can also add other columns which allows to do search on them later on.
    - We can edit in grid view for fast editing
    - We can make some columns required
  - versioning: can access previous versions of the file
    - by default, file not locked when editing so everybody can modify it at once
    - to block others from editing, we can `check out` the file. When it is finished we can `check in`. It allows us to see a comment that is shown in the version history
